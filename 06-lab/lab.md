# Lab 01
For our first lab, we're going to actually build out a complete command line version of the game of war, wrapping up the last two homework assignments.

The lab can be found here: https://github.com/ga-students/JS-DC-4-Lab01

Your completed lab is due, by pull request, before the start of our next class.

Best of luck!
