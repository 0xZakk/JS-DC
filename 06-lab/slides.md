## Node Package Manager

--
### NPM
Package manager for managing project dependencies

--
### NPM
A dependency is any third party code that our application depends on

--
### NPM
Lets see it in action!

---
## Building a Program
How do we break our program up in to multiple files?

---
## Lab

--
### Building out a Command Line Game
Todays' lab is to build out a working prototype for a command line implementation of the card game, `War`.

--
### Instructions
- The lab is detailed in `lab.md`

--
### Rules
- A deck of cards is shuffled and divided between two players
- Each player draws a card; the player who draws the higher card wins
- If the cards match, both players draw another card until a player wins

--
### Requirements
- run your game from the command line
- keep track of where you are in the game
- declare a winner

--
### Getting Started
Don't jump right into coding!
- What classes might you need?
- What logic might you need?
- Can you break out the game into chunks that you can work on
semi-independently?

--
### Getting Unstuck
What should I do if I get stuck?
1. retrace your steps and `console.log` everything
2. look for similar problems you've already solved
3. ask your neighbor for help
4. put your hand up or slack Zakk & Christine

--
## Do not try to copy and paste code

--
# Good luck!

## Wrap up
How did we feel about this?
