### Instructions
- The lab is detailed in `lab.md`

### Rules
- A deck of cards is shuffled and divided between two players
- Each player draws a card; the player who draws the higher card wins
- If the cards match, both players draw another card until a player wins

--
### Requirements
- run your game from the command line
- keep track of where you are in the game
- declare a winner

### Getting Unstuck
What should I do if I get stuck?
1. retrace your steps and `console.log` everything
2. look for similar problems you've already solved
3. ask your neighbor for help
4. put your hand up or slack Zakk & Christine
