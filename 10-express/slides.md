3. Activity 2: Pokedex

---
## Web Application Architecture

--
### Full Stack application
1. Client
2. Server

--
### The Client

--
### The Server

--
### Client and Server Relationship

---
### Communication

--
### Communication Structure
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

--
### HTTP Request: URL
`http://www.domain.com:1234/path/to/resource?a=b&x=y`
<br /><br />
protocol | port | path | query parameters | host

--
### HTTP Request: Method
|        |                  |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| GET    | ​read​ some data   |

​"Cookie"​ - a list of cookies that have been set on the browser
​"Auth"​ - encrypted auth information
​"Content-type"​ - tells server what kind of content is inside the request
​"Origin"​ - where the request came from

--
### HTTP Request: Body

## Important Concepts to takeaway
|        |                  |
| ------- | ----- |
| Client | The front end of our Application |
| Server | The back end of our application |
| HTTP | Communication between client and server |
| HTTP Request | Request for data from the front end of our application |
| URL | Universal Resource Locator |
| HTTP Response | Servers response after processing the request |

---
## Our First Server

---
## Pokedex
The pokedex is an application where users can find information about specific pokemon.

On the homepage, it lists every pokemon with a link to see more information about a specific pokemon

On the page for a specific pokemon, we can see all of the details we have for that pokemon.
