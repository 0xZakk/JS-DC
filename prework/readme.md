# Before Class

1. Complete the [JS Pre-Work Prompt](./prework.pdf). You should all have received this already, but in any case, make sure you have gone through it before the first class. There are some extra tutorials and resources included, so be sure take a look!

2. Accept your Slack invitation. Slack is a group chat tool you'll be using to stay in touch with your instructors and classmates during JS. I've just sent you all email invites to our class specific team. Once you're signed into Slack, upload a profile picture and introduce yourself in the #general channel!

3. Fill out your [GA Student Profile](https://mobilega.typeform.com/to/DbXlOu?course_name=javascript-development&campus=washington-dc&start_date=3-7-2016&github=yes&location=us&core_id=19434)
