### Classes

### Class 00: Installfest
Welcome to Intro to JavaScript! Our first class will focus on getting set up, learning the course objectives and meeting the instructors, staff and your fellow students.

#### Learning Objectives
* Get to know your classmates, instructors, and staff members.
* Install the tools we'll need to be successful in this course, including Node.js, npm, and Git
* Explain the structure of the course and tools that will be used.
* Discuss the benchmarks for assessments in terms of class participation, homework, and unit projects.
* Answer the question, what makes JavaScript important?
* Start answering the question, What is JavaScript?

#### Materials
- [Lesson Plan](00-installfest/lesson_plan.md)
- [Slides](https://ga-students.github.io/JS-DC/00-installfest)


### Class 01: Command Line

In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of navigating the file system on your computer with a tool called the command line. We'll also dive into working with a command line tool called Git and a companion tool called GitHub.

#### Learning Objectives
- Learn how to work in the Terminal
- Learn the basics of Git and GitHub

#### Materials
- [Slides](https://ga-students.github.io/JS-DC/01-command-line)
- [Lesson Notes](01-command-line-JS/lesson_plan.md)
- [Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf3uu66NAdM)

### Class 02: Data Types
Data types are the most atomic unit of any program. Javascript has many basic data types, which we cover in this lesson, and a couple of complex data types. We'll be introduced to Arrays at the end of the class as our first complex data type.

#### Learning Objectives
- Describe the concept of a "data type" and how it relates to variables
- Declare, assign to, and manipulate data stored in a variable
- Create arrays and access values in them

#### Materials

- [Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZPOUf5Ddg)

### Class 03: Control Flow
Programming is often described as following a recipe - in this lesson, we discuss why it's more nuanced than that by looking at control flow - ways we can control what code gets executed and the conditions under which it gets executed.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand different types of control flow including linear, conditional and iterative
- Understand how to implement different types of control flow, including `if` and `if/else statements`, `for` loops and `while` loops

#### Materials

- [Lesson Notes](03-control-flow/lesson_plan.md)
- [Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO0SdPEt044)

### Class 04: Functions
Now that we know how to work with data and control when certain actions are performed by our program, we need a way to encapsulate code so we can reuse it. Functions let us write code that will perform an action whenever we ask it to do so.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand what functions are and how, when and why to use them
- Declare our first function
- Understand parameters and arguments and how they relate to functions
- Understand the basics of scope
- Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem

### Class 05: Objects
Our final class on Javascript as a language covers Objects. This lesson will also cover Object Oriented Programming, a paradigm often held in opposition to Functional Programming, which we talked about in the last class.

#### Learning Objectives
- Create and modify JavaScript Objects
- Use Objects to model complex data
- Get and Set properties of Objects

#### Materials

Today's class goes in depth on event driven development: responding to browser/user events with Javascript  and writing event handlers.

#### Learning Objectives
- Listen for events using JavaScript
- Understand how to work with events and how to implement event handlers
- Learn about event propogation

### Class 09: Templating
We can use JavaScript for more than just the logic of our application: we can also use it as part of building the front end! Templating is a way for us to break up large HTML files into small, manageable parts that we can control using JavaScript.

#### Learning Objectives
- Use Handlebars templates to turn JS into HTML
- build a simple dynamic application using Handlebars and JS

### Class 10: Express
Time to jump back to the server! In this class, we'll learn about how the client and server communicate as well as how to build out a server using Express.

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain the two parts of a web application
- Identify all the parts of HTTP requests and responses
- Understand server architecture and build a server with `Express`

### Class 11: CRUD and Databases
By this point, we've built out our views and our server, all we're missing is a way to persist data. We'll learn about MongoDB and Mongoose - tools we can use to setup a database and work with it through our server.

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between different types of databases
- Describe what CRUD operations are and how they are used
- Describe an ORM
- Set up a simple `Express` application that uses `Mongoose` as an ORM to connect to a `MongoDB` database

### Class 12: Application Architecture
We now know almost everything we need to in order to build full scale,
feature-rich applications! The last step is to learn how we can organize
the different parts of our application.

#### Learning Objectives
- Learn about different architecture patterns for building applications

class will cover working with external data sources through AJAX and
building APIs with Express.

#### Learning Objectives
